# 3.3 Specification of Tokens
## 3.3.2
### a
Strings that start and end with a, and with arbitary number of a or b between start and end.

### b
Arbitary repeats of a, b, ab, abb, abbb, ...

### c
Strings that start with arbitary number of a or b and end with one of the following: aaa, aab, aba, abb.

### d
Strings of three b that are separated by arbitary number of a.

### e
Strings that contain even number of a and b.

## 3.3.3
### a
n + 1. A prefix of string s is any string obtained by removing zero or more symbols from the end of s.

### b
n + 1. A suffix of string s is any string obtained by removing zero or more symbols from the beginning of s.

### c
n - 1. Proper prefixes are prefixes that are not $\epsilon$ or not equal to itself.

### d
A substring of s is obtained by deleting any prefix and any suffix from s. So the length of substring could be 0 to n. Given $0 \leq m \leq n$ as the length of substring, when m = 0, the substring is $\epsilon$. When $1 \leq m \leq n$, we can choose the first n - m + 1 letters in string as the start of a substring. So the number of substrings is $1 + \sum_{m = 1}^{n}(n - m + 1) = 1 + \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}$.

### e
A subsequence of s is any string formed by deleting zero or more not necessarily consecutive position of s. Thus, we can generate subsequences by deleting 0 letter, 1 letter, 2 letters, ..., n letters from s. So the number of subsequences is $C_n^0 + C_n^1 + C_n^2 + \ldots + C_n^n = \sum_{i = 0}^{n}C_n^i$.
