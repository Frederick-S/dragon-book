## 2.2.5
### a
Let's prove that if `num` is divisible by 3, then the productions `num 0` and `num num` are also divisible by 3.

We know `num 0` = `num * 2`, so if num is divisible by 3, it's obvious `num * 2` is also divisible by 3.

Now let's check another production `num num`. Suppose we have $num_1$ and $num_2$, $num_1$ has $n_1$ digits and $num_2$ has $n_2$ digits, so $num_1 \text{ } num_2$ = $num_1 * 2^{n_2} + num_2$. Since both $num_1$ and $num_2$ are divisible by 3, we can let $num_1 = 3k_1$, $num_2 = 3k_2$, so $num_1 \text{ } num_2 = 3k_12^{n_2} + 3k_2 = 3(k_12^{n_2} + k_2)$, which is also divisible by 3.

Last, let's check the base case. The base cases are `num = 11` and `num = 1001`, both are divisible by 3.

So all binary strings generated by the grammar have values divisible by 3.
