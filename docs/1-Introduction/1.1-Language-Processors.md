# 1.1 Language Processors
## 1.1.1
A compiler reads a program in one language and translates it into an equivalent program in another language.

An interpreter directly executes the operations specified in the source program on inputs supplied by the user.

## 1.1.2
### a
A compiler can detect errors like typo, type mismatch in the source program during the translation process eaisly. And the machine-language target program produced by a compiler is usually much faster than an interpreter at mapping inputs to outputs.

### b
An interpreter can usually give better error diagnostics than a compiler.

## 1.1.3
Assembly language is easier to produce as output and is easier to debug.

## 1.1.4
The C language can be compiled using a relatively straightforward compiler to provide low-level capabilities. And a standards-compliant and portably written C program can be compiled for a very wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code.

## 1.1.5
It processes the assembly language to relocatable machine code as its output.
